Description: Performs the detection of point anomalies and linear trend changes 
    for univariate time series by implementing the bottom-up unbalanced wavelet transformation 
    proposed by H. Maeng and P. Fryzlewicz (2019) <http://personal.lse.ac.uk/maengh/>. 
    The estimated number and locations of the change-points are returned with the 
    piecewise-linear estimator for signal.
