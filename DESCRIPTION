Description: Performs the detection of linear trend changes for univariate time series 
    by implementing the bottom-up unbalanced wavelet transformation proposed by 
    H. Maeng and P. Fryzlewicz (2021). The estimated number and locations of the 
    change-points are returned with the piecewise-linear estimator for signal.
